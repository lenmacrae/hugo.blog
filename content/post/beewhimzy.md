New website created as a portfolio for my wife's knitting and crochet creations. I found a very nice [Hugo theme](https://github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme) for this purpose. Amazon S3 static site hosting is essentially free, so the only cost was domain registration. 
Next step is to try and setup a contact form running on AWS lambda.
Take a look at [beewhimzy.com](http://beewhimzy.com)
